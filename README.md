# Features
Create: Users can create new notes by clicking on the "New Note" button. This will open a new note with an empty title and content.

Read: Notes are displayed in a list on the left side of the screen. Clicking on a note's title in the list will display its content on the right side of the screen.

Update: To edit a note, simply click on the note's title in the list. The content of the note will become editable, allowing you to make changes. Click the "Save" button to save your changes.

Delete: Deleting a note is easy. While editing a note, you'll find a "Delete" button. Clicking this button will prompt you to confirm the deletion. Once confirmed, the note will be removed from the list.

# Technologies Used
HTML: Used for structuring the app's user interface and elements.

CSS: Styled the app's interface to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.

JavaScript: Implemented the app's functionality, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting notes, all of which are managed using the browser's localStorage.

# Future Improvements
While this version of the Notable Note Taking App is a basic implementation, there are several potential areas for improvement:

User Authentication: Implement user accounts and authentication to allow multiple users to have their own set of notes.

Rich Text Formatting: Enhance the note editor to support rich text formatting options like bold, italics, and bullet points.

Categories or Tags: Add the ability to categorize or tag notes for better organization.

Syncing: Implement cloud-based syncing to allow users to access their notes from different devices.
